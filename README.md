**Summary:**

This project is a direct comparison of prison escapees between the United States vs India.

- The USA currently ranks number one for the incarceration rates in the world and India currently ranks fifth. 
At the end of 2013, the USA had a whopping 861 incarcerated persons per 100,000 residents and India had only 131 incarcerated persons per 100,000 residents
- As of 2013, 250,103 inmates have escaped in the USA since 1978.
- In India, a total of 10,050 inmates as of 2013 have escaped since 2001. And, the preferred method of escaping is from police custody then the second was 
from inside prison and about 1/4 of inmates escapees have been re-arrested.
- The likelihood of seeing an escapee without knowing is less than 1 percent or 2 per 100,000 residents in the USA. Now you can wonder!
